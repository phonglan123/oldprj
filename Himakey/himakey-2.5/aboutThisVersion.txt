@petavietnam petavietnam released this on Jul 31, 2020 · 14 commits to master since this release

Text editor (WYSIWYG): With this editor (powered by TinyMCE), it will be easier for you to compose content, we also support extremely many great features through this editor. Try it out!
Himakey point/level: Hope you enjoy it!!! - Icon and idea from Todoist Karma!
Support import and export data by file, makes sharing data easier (no need to copy, just share files)
Color mark: Like Tagging :)
Eliminate data sharing via copying. Because copying is no longer appropriate, we have removed this feature
